                <p>“I’m a masterpiece! I’m a masterpiece! Look at me, I am Anna,” shouted drag queen Yuhua Hamasaki as she riled up the crowd in full Anna Delvey garb at the imprisoned fake heiress’ one-night-only solo art exhibit. Hamasaki’s over-the-top impression of the subject of Shonda Rhimes’ Netflix limited series “Inventing Anna” was just the start of a surreal experience put on by the Founders Art Club and Delvey’s art dealer, Christopher Martine, at New York City’s Public Hotel on Thursday night.</p>

                <p>Drag Story Hour (DSH) is just what it sounds like—drag queens reading stories to children. DSH captures the imagination and play of the gender fluidity of childhood and gives kids glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models. In these spaces, kids are able to see people who defy rigid gender restrictions and imagine a world where people can present as they wish, where dress up is real.</p>
